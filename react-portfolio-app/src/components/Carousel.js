              I love doing whatever makes my family and I happy. Whether it's playing sports, going to the movies, or just hanging out, I love it!  Hiking the outdoors and taking pictures at National Parks are just a few of my favorite things to do.  Sitting around spending time with my family on vacation, we love everything!  Most of all, my family are my food buddies; because I love to eat everything I drag my family around
              with me just trying to make sure they are happy and to to try any dish atleast once!

              I created this portfolio page, with more to come. I am
              continuously growing and acheiving experience with every step
              taken into a career of software development. Below I will
              consistently add projects that I have created and/or have
              contributed to. I stand by my morals in this new world of
              development, that "hardwork, dedication, and commitment to
              excellence is the foundation of a brighter future for oneself!"
