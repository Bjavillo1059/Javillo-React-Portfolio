        I love doing whatever makes my family and I happy. Whether it's hiking
        the outdoors, taking pictures at National Parks, or even just sitting
        around spending time with my family on vacation. We love everything!
        Most of all, my family are my food buddies; because I love to eat
        everything I drag my family around with me just to try any dish atleast
        once!
