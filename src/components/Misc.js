                    <p> I love doing whatever makes my family and I happy. Whether it's hiking the outdoors, taking pictures at National parks,    
                    or even just sitting around spending time with my family on vacation.  We love everything! Most of all, my family are
                    my food buddies; because I love to eat everything I drag my family around with me just try any dish atleast once!
